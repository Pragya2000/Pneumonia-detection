# Pneumonia-detection

ML-Pneumonia-Detector
Introduction:
A Deep Learning powered system that helps in the prediction of Pneumonia with an accuracy of 90.529% test accuracy only. The system compares X-Ray images of human lungs to help predict the disease with the application of Swagger API.

Why?
Pneumonia is lung inflammation caused by infection with virus, bacteria, fungi or other pathogens. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), chest x-ray is the best test for pneumonia diagnosis. However, reading x-ray images can be tricky and requires domain expertise and experience. It would be nice if we can just ask a computer to read the images and tell us the results.
Although the project does have a throughput of around 91%(round of), it is still advised to consult a doctor before following any treatment.
This project is just a step towards easing the whole process of consulting a doctor everytime.This project provides a normal person the ability to detect if something is off with their chest x-rays and save them some consultation fee!
